# 🍋‍🟩 Limelight 

This code is very similar to my [Teleoperated Code](https://github.com/raphacnas/Teleop-Code/tree/master), since it has been made out of that code. Nevetheless, it adds a `TagFollower` function, that works in the autonomous mode of the robot.

For any further understanding of the way it works, acess `limelight's documentation` down below:
